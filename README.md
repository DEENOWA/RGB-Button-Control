# RGB-Button-Control
RGBButtonControl is an Arduino-based project that uses three push buttons to independently control a red, green, and blue LED. Each button toggles its corresponding LED on or off when pressed, with debouncing implemented via a 50ms delay. The system is simple and ideal for learning button-LED interfacing.
